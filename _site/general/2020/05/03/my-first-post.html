<p>Well, at least is what my console says, let I proper introduce myself.
My name is Thiago Reque and I’m a IT geek for a long time now, I never thought I’ll write a blog but lately this idea start to change and I decided to create this blog due 2 things (mostly):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I saw a lot of things/problems/puzzles/etc in my career that must be useful to help someone (maybe for you that is reading right now).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To evolve my writing (thats why I chose to write in English) and to be more clear on my thoughts.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, I’ll explain a few things about who am I.</p>

<p><strong>Professionaly</strong></p>

<p>I’m working with IT since 2010 when I got my intership as DBA at Ilegra which is a company in my hometown. 
Initialy I worked with multiple RDBMS plataforms but after 1 year I focused my carreer to work with Microsoft SQL Server. In this years working with MSSQL I took my 2 certifications for SQL Server 2008 R2 (MCTS and MCITP). In 2016 I started to study other RDBMS after being focused in one for so long and I started to work with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and MongoDB (yes, a Non-relational database as well).</p>

<p>In the end of 2016 I left Ilegra and in 2017 I started at Whitecube, which is a company specialized in Microsft. With them I worked with a few projects envolving PowerBI, MySQL with HA, and a little of Azure besides MSSQL.</p>

<p>At the end of 2017 I received a offer to work at 4all which is where I work to this day.
I started as a MySQL DBA, lefting MSSQL after 7 years, this wasn’t about the technology but this opportunity brought me more challenges and 4all was a startup, so I left a consultant job to work in a product and this was a great change of scenary.</p>

<p>My team at 4all was very small with me as a DBA and other two collegues, one AWS Architect and the other was Helpdesk besides our manager, after 1 month the AWS Architect left on vacations and I took your responsibilities. During this time I had to made a migration from IBM to AWS for one C# application and let me say, “WOW, that was crazy”. I had a small experience with AWS and none with IBM and the migration was successfully and I felt great (I can post something about this in another opportunity).</p>

<p>After this I started to help my collegue with some AWS demands, a few months later my manager and this collegue left the company and I became the Cloud Architect with a new manager, we hire a new Cloud Architect after 3 months and a new intern for the Helpdesk.
At November 2018 my manager left and he recommended my name for the CEO as a new manager and in December 2018 I became the new IT Infrastructure manager at 4all, but I didn’t stop working with AWS and was more requested as I ever thought and also I had to understand how to manage a team, all on-premisses network and security systems as well.</p>

<p><strong>Educationly</strong></p>

<p>My first contact with IT was at 2005 with a computer technician course which I finnished in 2007. I learned a lot about everything, includind databases a programming and this made me enter in the Computer Science Bachelor’s at Ulbra college in 2008.
At 2010 when a I got my internship the college was taking a very load on me so in 2011 I decided to pause the college.
At the 2015 I started a new college in analysis and systems development, which is a course more focused in development, which is something I like to study and do on my spare time and to help me to get more experience on query tunning and I finally got my degree in 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Personal</strong></p>

<p>I’m a headbanguer, geek and gamer. I currently live in Porto Alegre - RS - Brazil.</p>

<p>I listen to heavy metal since I’m 13 years old and I’m a huge Blind Guardian fan, with Pink Floyd, Iron Maiden, Amon Amarth and Symphony X in my top 5 bands.
About this age as well I started to play Magic the Gathering and D&amp;D 3.5 with my cousins and friends, I stopped after I left school but started to play tabletop RPGs again when I meet my girlfriend at the time (which is my wife now), she is a headbanguer, geek and gamer as well.
One of the thing I like to do in my spare time, besides gaming and develop is to drink some beers or whiskey, eat some pizzas (I’m getting good at baking my own pizzas) and play some eletric guitar. In this last year I started to use more bike to transportation but due to covid-19 I had to stop.</p>

<p>And here are my two cats, Lilica (11 years old) and Luna (9 years old) S2</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/lilica.jpg" alt="Lilica" width="200" height="200" style="border-radius: 50%;" />
<img src="/assets/media/luna.jpg" alt="Luna" width="200" height="200" style="border-radius: 50%;" /></p>

<p>That its me!
About the blog, I’ll try to post weekly something about RDBMS, AWS, or some problem that I cross at work.
The content will be mostly about technology and experiences but I can post something non-related to tech that I found interesting to share ;)</p>
